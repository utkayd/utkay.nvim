# utkay.nvim
This is my personal setup for nvim. Some of the modules might not work for you but feel free to replicate/read. 
Run `git clone https://github.com/utkayd/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim` to make it yours
If you have previous configuration, I advise you make a backup first using `mv ~/.config/nvim{,.backup}`
